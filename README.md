# Computational-Neuroscience
A repository for modelling and simulation of models in computational neuroscience
I recently devloped a(n) (un)healthy relationship with computational neuroscience. I upload my code files here!
Some of the models that are included in this repo include: 
1. The Hodgkin-Huxley model
2. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model
3. The Integrate-and-Fire model
4. The Neural Field equations
5. The Allen-Cahn equations
6. The Kuramoto model
7. Neural Mass model
8. The Reaction-Diffusion equation
9. Boltzmann Machines
10. Research topic: Bilateral Olfactory Search and Navigation
